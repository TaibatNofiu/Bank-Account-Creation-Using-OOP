The objective is to create a Python class named "Account" with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking balances, encapsulated in a script called "bank_account.py" to simulate basic bank account operations.

Create a class called "Account" that has the following attributes:

account_number (string)
account_balance (float)
account_holder (string)
The class should have the following methods:

deposit(amount: float) - This method should add the amount passed as an argument to the account balance.
withdraw(amount: float) - This method should subtract the amount passed as an argument from the account balance, but only if the account balance is greater than the amount being withdrawn.
check_balance() - This method should return the current account balance.
